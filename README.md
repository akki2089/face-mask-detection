## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/108KDCyi_J2oO4lqTFe2u_uwymeKiUW-Z?usp=sharing)

This dataset consists of __3833 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 1915 images__
*	__without_mask: 1918 images__

The images used was real images of faces wearing masks. The images was collected from the __Kaggle datasets__
